Resources for this project included the LIWC 2007 lexicon, used with permission directly from Jamie Pennebaker at UT.

If you wish to use that resource, you'll need to request it directly from Pennebaker, in which case it would make more sense to request the most up-to-date lexicon. Alternatively, and probably simpler, you could instead modify things to use Stanford's Empath, which is similar to LIWC in spirit (although not psychometrically validated) and actually has quite a few more categories.  In any case, neither LIWC nor a LIWC-like resource is critical for this project.
